## Discussion

* TODO: Discuss the following:
  * We found a lot of intermingled MCRs, not so much with the others (plasmids etc.)
  * Why were some UBAs not covered? (plasmids)
  * What should we do with naming, especially as new variants are discovered and fill in the tree?
  * Taxonomic anomolies and how they may be explained
  * There were many clinical samples represented that *did* yeild MCRs, but the recovery could be bad
