## Conclusion

* The data for three of the four phylogenetic analyses were not ideal for expanding on the known diversity of AMR homologs. These beta lactamase phylogenies did, however show the importance of unambiguous naming schemes, and care when it comes to presenting data honestly. 
* The study also showed that it is important to take the type of data into consideration, and metagenomic sequencing must come a long way before these studies can produce quality information.
* MCR is a good candidate for this type of study because it has the right balance of homology and diversity in the group, and is an example of a better naming scheme.
