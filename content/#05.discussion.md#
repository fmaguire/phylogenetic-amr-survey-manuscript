## Discussion

* TODO: Discuss the following:
  * Messed up nomenclature
  * We found a lot of intermingled MCRs, not so much with the others (plasmids etc.)
  * Why were some UBAs not covered? (plasmids)
  * What should we do with naming, especially as new variants are discovered and fill in the tree?
  * Taxonomic anomalies and how they may be explained
  * There were many clinical samples represented that *did* yield MCRs, but the recovery could be bad

In this study, the phylogenetic neighborhoods of several named AMR genes are characterized by their diversity, spread, and potential for discovering possibly novel AMR variants.
