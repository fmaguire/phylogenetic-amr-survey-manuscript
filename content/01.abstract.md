## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The increase and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global threat to human and animal health.
Surveillance of potential AMR determinants is vital to monitor and combat AMR.
Phylogenetic analyses of the evolution and transmission of antimicrobial resistance determinants are vital to this surveillance and in prioritising experimental molecular studies.
Effective application of phylogenetics requires development of systematic nomenclature of AMR gene variants.
In this study, the phylogenetic neighborhoods of several mobilised AMR gene families, of public-health importance, were examined for diversity, spread, and consistency in existing nomenclature.
These gene families include: mobile colistin resistance (MCR), New Delhi beta-lactamase (NDM), Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), and OXA-48 beta-lactamase lactamase family.
Canonical genes in the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) for these families were used to query CARD resistomes and prevalence data, NCBI sequence data, and draft quality metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) from various uncultivated bacterial and archeal sources (UBAs).
Phylogenies were then generated and analysed for this expanded set of candidate resistance genes for each of these 4 families.
This highlighted several possibly novel clades of MCR resistance genes, although limited uncharacterised diversity in the carbapenemase beta-lactamase families.
The carbapenemases were found to be more tightly defined, with most added diversity being either extremely close, or phylogenetically distant.
The MCR family showed many new clades of diversity within canonical clades.
A large number of existing gene names within all 4 families were identified to be inconsistent with phylogeny or inconsequential in relation to the diversity they encompass.
Additionally, there was a huge variability in the diversity encompassed by individual allele names across the AMR gene families analysed.
These results highlight the need to develop consistent, robust, phylogenetically defined nomenclature for AMR genes.
